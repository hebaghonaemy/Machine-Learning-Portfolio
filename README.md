# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

## Contents



+ [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/hebaghonaemy/boston-housing): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

+ [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/hebaghonaemy/Finding-donors): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

+ [Supervised Learning: Detecting heart disease](https://github.com/hebaghonaemy/Heart_disease): Recognizing the patients more likely to have heart problems. Trying out different (supervised) models and finding the one with the highst accuracy.


+ [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/hebaghonaemy/customer_segments): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.

+ [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Quadcopter to fly](https://github.com/hebaghonaemy/Quadcopter-project): Creating an optimized agent that will navigate a Quadcopter through its environment towards a goal.

+ [Deep Learning: Identidying dog breeds]: Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize breed of dogs in image and also find the dog that most lood like the human in the picture.

+ [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs]:(https://github.com/hebaghonaemy/Dog-breeds) Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.
